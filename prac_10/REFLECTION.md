# Practical 10

## Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?
Initially, in the first practical that asked for estimates I serverly would underestimate how long a task would take,
thus my accuracy was quite poor. Later into the course however, both my coding speed and ability got better as well
as my estimates were made to be more realistic resulting in improved accuracy. 

## Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
I found that providing helpful and accurate code reviews was not a simple as I initially expected, but they are quite
helpful particularly if they were done before submission. I actually alot from reviewing others code and seeing
different and better approaches to the same task, while being reviewed many times highlighted both simple mistakes and
crucial oversights.

## Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
The practicals themselves were well-made and informative, however I didn't find the marking system adequate. Many of
the practicals required more than 4 files to be submitted but had a marking system out of 4. I also never knew which 
comments made were the reason for losing marks and which were just informative. I would propose a larger mark range, 
say out of 10, and each comment made can specify how many marks were actually deducted for the mistake.
